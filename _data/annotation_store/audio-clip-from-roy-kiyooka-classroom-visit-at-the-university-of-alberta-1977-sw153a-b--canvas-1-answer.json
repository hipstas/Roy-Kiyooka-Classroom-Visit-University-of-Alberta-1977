I'm tired of having to work within structures in which discourse has a very precise limitation, and that [limitation] is time. And most universities are time-machines in that sense. A forty minute reading is nothing really. I mean what can't get said is . . . you know it's forty minutes [unitelligble], but no more than that. If you want more you have to [unintellgible] attend to it unconditionally. Being an artist teaches me that over and over again, and it sets me against aspects of institutional [lies?], which are time-machines, because I think what can therefore be learned within them is conditional, in ways that, I don't know, you have to undo after you've been schooled in order to regain time in a valuable way, essential way, necessary way.",
