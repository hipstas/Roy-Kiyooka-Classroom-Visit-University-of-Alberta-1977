I mean, you [the students] say you haven't read the books and that's fine, but you've heard Roy read some of his letters, and, were you bothered by a lot of things that you couldn't understand because they were private records or even the names of the people he was writing to? Did that cause trouble? I was intrigued for example that you [Roy Kiyooka] didn't bother explaining who Victor was or who any of those people [mentioned in the letters] were. That wasn't important to you in reading the poem so publicly. ",
