0	39	Doug Barbour: Well I don't know if it's a valid question to you [Roy Kiyooka], because you've put them [the letters in transcanada letters] out there and they're there, but I suspect, I don't know if I'm being fair to you people [the students] or not in asking you what, [after] hearing that, [are] your responses? I mean, you [the students] say you haven't read the books and that's fine, but you've heard Roy read some of his letters, and, were you bothered by a lot of things that you couldn't understand because they were private records or even the names of the people he was writing to? Did that cause trouble? I was intrigued for example that you [Roy Kiyooka] didn't bother explaining who Victor was or who any of those people [mentioned in the letters] were. That wasn't important to you in reading the poem so publicly. 	Question
40	162	Roy Kiyooka: I had the occasion a couple of years ago, just after I met Daphne, of saying to her "I'm sick of reading. I'm tired of hearing my own voice. I'm tired of having to work within structures in which discourse has a very precise limitation, and that [limitation] is time. And most universities are time-machines in that sense. A forty minute reading is nothing really. I mean what can't get said is . . . you know it's forty minutes [unitelligble], but no more than that. If you want more you have to [unintellgible] attend to it unconditionally. Being an artist teaches me that over and over again, and it sets me against aspects of institutional [lies?], which are time-machines, because I think what can therefore be learned within them is conditional, in ways that, I don't know, you have to undo after you've been schooled in order to regain time in a valuable way, essential way, necessary way.	Answer
163	219	Student 1: What are you saying specifically about your diaries? Because I found them terribly uninteresting. And I didn't really . . . A few of the things that you were saying I understood, but I couldn't help saying to myself, "so what?"  Could you tell me some kind of approach, new and different approach, to writing like yours and your writing that might help me with it? Because I am certainly willing to learn what you want to say, but it's just not happening.	Question
220	228	Roy Kiyooka laughs	Laughter
229	232	Roy Kiyooka: Gosh, you got a problem you know.	Response
232	234	Audience laughs	Laughter
235	240	Student 1: It's not only your writing, it's a lot of modernist writing. I understand it.	Comment
241	319	Roy Kiyooka: Well, I've been a teach a long time and I know guys like you. I've got young kids in the university who, though some part of their consciousness is shaped by the fact that they were born subsequent to the Second World War, that they have had television in their lives since their infancy, that they've had a large measure of life's comforts given a priori, but their heads nonetheless belong somewhere in the 17th, 18th, and19th century. And that is curious to me. I mean what don't you understand  about the language of this moment in time, this moment that you are living in, and what are the impediments to it? 	Question
320	327	Student 1: Well personally I think I understand this language in this time that I'm living in	Comment
328	330	Roy Kiyooka: You don't like it?	Interruption
331	347	Student 1: I didn't say, well, maybe I did. Maybe I shouldn't have said that I don't understand what you're saying. But I don't understand what kind of significance it should have for me.	Comment
348	354	Roy Kiyooka: Well I can't understand that either, of course. How can I understand that?	Response
355	363	Student 1: Right, and what I'm asking you is that -- is there anyway I could find some significance in your work?	Question
364	369	Roy Kiyooka: Yah, sure. Find yourself.	Answer
370	371	Roy Kiyooka laughs	Laughter
372	418	Roy Kiyooka: I'm being facetious. It's very hard to find the artefacts or the ideas or the concepts or the images in the world that one can feel an empathy for if they don't, at some deep part of themself, know what it means to be empathetic. Is that an answer? Or is that like my letters?	Answer
419	426	Student 2: Your intent in writing it is not to make an intellectualized statement, it is more or less to relate an emotional experience.	Comment
427	432	Roy Kiyooka: It is to relate an emotional and intellectual complex	Response
434	442	Student 2: An emotional and intellectual complex? Can you explain that further? What do you mean? 	Question
443	453	Roy Kiyooka: How much of yourself can you put into a work? A song?	Answer
454	458	Student 2: It's the last word there, "complex," [unintelligible]	Question
459	484	Roy Kiyooka: Oh I think everybody is complicated. I don't understand you and you don't understand me, I mean isn't that complicated? Goddamnit! Well okay but there is a difference here. What I'm trying to say is, I'm trying to articulate that complexity. That's what I'm trying to say. That's what I'm trying to do, at this moment.	Answer
485	507	Student 3: I found in your letters some of them had some messages in them I could grasp but a lot of them were too personal for me or, you know, most other people to understand. Like when you write a letter you're talking to that person, yoi obviously have something to say to that person,  and it is not necessarily applicable to everyone, or they can't grasp it because they don't know the circumstances that surround it. 	Comment
508	552	Roy Kiyooka: Oh well, is there's one letter in the book that you could get your head around and say, you know, "it speaks to me," then it's the letter I should have written to you, perhaps. I mean, you know, you don't put a big book together like that. [Unintellgible,], fifteen people are going to come and sing your praise and there would be an absolute consensus that they loved every word of it. Come on now. That's part of some dreadful simplistic notion of the experience of anything.	Response
553	562	Doug Barbour: Your willing to sacrifice, or your willing to have a reader miss a good portion of that book if something get through to them, then?	Question
563	568	Roy Kiyooka: Well I don't what I meant for the reader when I put the work together, really. 	Answer
569	571	Doug Barbour: You weren't worried about a reader then?	Question
572	631	Roy Kiyooka: No, you don't put together a book without worrying about a reader, but you may not know who that reader is, in any partcular way. I mean, I didn't put the book together with you in mind or Stephen in mind or any of you in mind, and yet I must have held the notion of somebody in mind. I think the notion of being an artist implictly proposits another. For me it does. 	Answer
632	634	Doug Barbour: So you do want to reach out?	Question
635	671	Roy Kiyooka: Oh, of course. But on whose terms? On whose terms? The only ground that I have some certainty baout, vis-Ã -vis whose terms, is my own. I mean I can't possibly have that for you. 	Answer
